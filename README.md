NLP Term Project - Task 4

Task 4 is centered around Sentiment Analysis in Tweets. This task is centered around the following 4 subtasks, pulled directly from the [SemEval2016 Website](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task4/).

## Subtask A: Message Polarity Classification
Given a tweet, predict whether the tweet is of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. (This is SemEval-2015 task 10, subtask B, which we want to keep due to its popularity -- it has attracted 40 teams; however, we are retiring what was SemEval-2015 task 10, subtask A)

## Subtask B: Tweet classification according to a two-point scale
Given a tweet known to be about a given topic, classify whether the tweet conveys a positive or a negative sentiment towards the topic. (This is a simplification of Subtask C as from SemEval-2015 task 10, which also required to filter out tweets that were not about the topic, and which (like Subtask A does now) also involved the Neutral class.)

## Subtask C: Tweet classification according to a five-point scale
Given a tweet known to be about a given topic, estimate the sentiment conveyed by the tweet towards the topic on a five-point scale.

## Subtask D: Tweet quantification according to a two-point scale
Given a set of tweets known to be about a given topic, estimate the distribution of the tweets across the Positive and Negative classes.

## Subtask E: Tweet quantification according to a five-point scale
Given a set of tweets known to be about a given topic, estimate the distribution of the tweets across the five classes of a five-point scale.
